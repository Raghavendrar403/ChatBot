# ChatBot
This is the final year group project. We are building a generative based travel agent chatbot
cities.txt - Contains the names of the cities which need to be parsed
webScrapper.py - reads the cities.txt file and then scrapes the data from holidify.com website and saves the html files
parset.py - parses the html files and then generates json files which contain the famous places in cities with their description
